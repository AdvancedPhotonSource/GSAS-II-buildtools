# Triggers for needing to run this would be if there are changes to any
# of these files: 
#    install/gitstrap.py
#    install/g2complete/*
#    install/g2full/*
#    https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/tree/master/GSASII/**
# but I am not sure we need to rebuild that often. Perhaps should just rebuild only on
# creation of a new tag # in AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II
