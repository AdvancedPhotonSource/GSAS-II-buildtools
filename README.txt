This repo contains files used for building GSAS-II binaries and
distribution kits. g2pkg, used to create a conda package
(briantoby::gsas2pkg) is in reasonable shape.

g2complete and g2full are currently being adapted to work from git.

The files here are probably only of use for GSAS-II packaging & perhaps developers.
