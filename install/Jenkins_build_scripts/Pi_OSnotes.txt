== OS notes ==

For Buster I used a SD card provided by !PiShop.US

The imager and the USB SD card imager (sudo apt install
rpi-imager) seems the easiest way to install images on a SD card. 

I also loaded Bullseye OS versions from here:

https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/#raspberry-pi-os-32-bit

To create the SD use these steps on Mac (also see [https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ this]):
* In disk utility, format as MS-DOS (FAT) with Master Boot Record (may not be needed)
* use commands: 
 * {{{diskutil list}}} to find sd card mount point (disk4)
 * {{{sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4}}} this dismounts the disk, but keeps it attached
 * {{{unzip -p /tmp/2021-10-30-raspios-bullseye-armhf.zip | sudo dd bs=1m of=/dev/rdisk4}}} copies the image to the SD card.

* When done the SD card is remounted as a disk
* Use {{{touch /Volumes/boot/ssh}}} to enable an ssh connection to the system
* Eject the "disk", for example in disk utility
