====================================================
This is a single-download installer for GSAS-II. It includes other
software such as subversion (svn, used to update GSAS-II), a Python 
interpreter and a number of Python packages required by GSAS-II. The
file you are running will install GSAS-II, Python, etc. and will then
run the bootstrap.py script to create shortcuts and will use svn to
update to the latest version of GSAS-II, if an internet connection is
available. Note that the bootstrap.py script can be rerun manually to
obtain updates.

*** Note that while this installer can be rerun to install the software
in a new location, once these files are installed, they should not be
moved. ***
