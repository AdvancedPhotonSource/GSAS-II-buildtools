====================================================
This is a single-download installer for GSAS-II. It includes other
software such as Git, used to install and update GSAS-II, a Python 
interpreter and a number of Python packages required by GSAS-II. The
installer you are running will install Python, etc. and then will install
the packaged version of GSAS-II, as listed above. Once that has been
completed, the software will invoke the gitstrap.py script, which will
use git to update to the latest version of GSAS-II (this requires an
internet connection). Then it will create shortcuts to simplify
GSAS-II use. Note that the gitstrap.py script can be rerun manually to
obtain updates. 

*** Note that while this installer can be used again to install
GSAS-II in a new location, once these files are installed, they should 
not be moved. ***

If you use GSAS-II in your research, please show your support by citing:
